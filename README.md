# Popping Dance Style Classification Through Inception V3 Feature Extraction and LSTM Classification

This program classifies Popping Dance Styles through using Inception V3 for feature extraction and LSTM for classification, as proposed by Harvey (2017) in his blog, Five Video Classification Methods.
This metholodogy was applied to my own dataset composed of 1310 Popping Dance style videos under 14 classes. 

See this link for the full details of the said blog https://medium.com/@harvitronix/five-video-classification-methods-implemented-in-keras-and-tensorflow-99cad29cc0b5

The whole methodology for method #4 (as adopted in this project) is seen in the same link. Refer to this for his github repository Popping-Dance-Style-Classification
